<strong>Rhino WIP (Grasshopper)</strong>

Rhino WIP  ( Grasshopper) is used for design which is having co relation setup. We can design a conenction with its value so it automatically change on refrance to other.


You can go through  tutorial of Rhino Grasshopper.<br>

In Mac you need to Download Rhino WIP from <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5.0/wip">https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5.0/wip</a>  You need Licence to run.

Taking a Point and than setting connection and commands<br><br>

You can set formula and its value by connecting them to one another<br>

Now as taking ahed you can joint to diffent values and commands with refrence and connecting them to make a final output <br> <br>

Different tabs and slider is available in which you can put value and start making formula.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Vinyl Cutter (Roland)</strong><br>

To cut <strong>Plz. Cut Above this line</strong> as user use to cut near blade area were IR sensor are thier which can probably spoil sensor. so a Notation was needed on machice that cutting line is here. 




<img src="old/images/screen/vclabel.jpeg" height="400"><br>

<ul>
  <li>Loading Vinly paper roll on rollar.</li>
  <li>Lift up the clamp situated at back side</li>
  <li>Pass paper through it.</li>
  <li>You can only cut till White marks shown on bar just above cuting blade.</li>
  <li>  Adjust sliding rollar to that white mark.</li>
  <li>Speed and pressure adjustment can be done in machine setting.</li>
  <li>Creating a file in Roland Cut Studio</li>
  <li>Simply by writing Letter of proper size you can do it.</li>
  <li>After setting proper size you can send as print file option to Roland</li>
  <li>It will start Cutting</li>
  <li>Pressure for blade should be 250 gram.</li>
</ul>
<br>



<strong> Casing for Gear Motor Robot ( Laser Cutting ) | Epilog </strong>
<br>
<img src="old/images/screen/botpf.jpeg" height="400"><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Box can be made  in Rhino or online file can be genrated.</li>
  <li><a href="http://boxdesigner.connectionlab.org/">http://boxdesigner.connectionlab.org/</a> This website give best option for quick box file genarating in inch / cm  </li>

  <li>Enter Data and genrate design open it into Rhino.</li>
  <img src="images/week3/connectionlab.png" alt="" width="500"> <br>
  <li>It download in pdf file that can be opened in Rhino and edit according to your need</li>
  <li>I have added to Small rectangles for wires and four holes for noter driver</li>

  <li> Machine setting for Cutting in our Epilog Laser cutter is  <font color="blue"> Speed : 5  Power : 100 Frequency : 2500 Hz</font></li>
</ul>

<strong> T - Shirt Printing </strong>
<br>
<img src="images/week3/tshirt.png" height="400"><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Design Created in Cut Studio</li>
  <li>Faced problem in writing local language ( Hindi )</li>
  <li>I used Google Input tool in Powerpoint then i snipped that Image fro slideshow.</li>
  <li>inserted that image to Cut Studio</li>
  <li>Added english letters to it</li>
  <li>Cutted design to vinyl</li>
  <li>Setup frame got negative to that frame</li>
  <li>By using Colour available at lab screen Printing was done on tshirt.</li>
  <li>Using a wooden sheet as seprated and base for holding T-shirt.</li>
</ul>


<hr>

<STRONG>Problem Faced</STRONG>
<ul>
  <li>MDF contains moisture then it hard to cut through with Epilog machine .</li>
  <li>While using <a href="http://boxdesigner.connectionlab.org/">boxdesigner.connectionlab.org</a> Cut width is not working properly. As on increasing in number of notches it would overlap more lenght at end and would not pressfit.</li>
 
</ul>

                        <ul>
                         <li>Keep MDF sheets on Plain surface , bend in sheet create probelm in cutting .</li>
  <li>Test material once with small circle of 5 mm diameter so you would have perfect power , speed and frequency its helps a lot in get job done in one go and save material wasting while prototyping.</li>
  <li>Few adjustment on Rhino may help you to save time in cutting. example joining line which can overlaped in design so it cut on single go.</li>
  <li>Use vernier for presicion of size if you are going mount components on it.</li>
  <li>Practising with design in laser cutting you can also try for saving material which can be used for other small projects later.</li>
                          <li>In vinyl cutting low gum tape is used but for small cuts u need to b very precise it can spoil your design.</li>
                          <li>Frame for T- Shirt Printing should be clean properly, moisture in frame makes airpokect and it may spoil prinitng</li>
